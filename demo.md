# Demo Page

Here is another example of using Git and GitHub. This file is a temporary file.

## Test

This update will test committing and pushing using VSCode instead of the CLI.

### Another test

Here, I'm modifying the file from GitHub. Apparently, this method is not recommended. Not sure why it isn't recommended, since it seems quite user-friendly.
